# Solver Compatibility Chart

This chart is for documenting the compatibility of the component solver packages
to the common interface. An `x` means that the option is implemented or the
add-on functionality will work with the given solver. A blank means that
the option has not been implemented or that a given add-on has not been tested
with a given package. If there are any errors in this chart, please file an
issue or submit a pull-request.

* x: Full compatibility
* p: Partial compatibility, only in nonstiff methods unless the Jacobian is provided.
* n: General compatibility, but not compatible with routines which.
  require being able to autodifferentiate through the entire solver.
* 0: Not possible. This is generally due to underlying inflexibility in a wrapped
  library.
* s: Special, Sundials has its own linear solver choices.
* ^: Only stiff (implicit) methods.
* †: For packages with compatibility, no warning is given when a specific algorithm
  does not need to use this feature.

All blank spaces are possible future additions.
