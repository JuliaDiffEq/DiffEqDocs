# BVP Solvers

## Recomended Methods

`GeneralMIRK4` is a good well-rounded method when the problem is not too large.
It uses highly stable trust region methods to solve a 4th order fully
implicit Runge-Kutta scheme. As an alternative on general `BVProblem`s, the
`Shooting` method paired with an appropriate integrator for the IVP, such as
`Shooting(Tsit5())`, is a flexible and efficient option. This will allow one
to combine callbacks/event handling with the BVP solver, and the high order
interpolations can be used to define complex boundary conditions. However,
`Shooting` methods can in some cases be prone to sensitivity of the boundary
condition.

When the problem is a large two-point boundary value problem that is sensitive
to the boundary conditions, `MIRK4` utilizes a sparse Jacobian to greatly
improve the efficiency.
