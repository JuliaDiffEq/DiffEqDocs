# Solver Benchmarks

Benchmarks for the solvers can be found at [DiffEqBenchmarks.jl](@ref).
Many different problems are tested. However, if you would like additional problems to be benchmarked, please open an issue or PR at the DiffEqBenchmarks.jl repository with the code that defines the DEProblem.
